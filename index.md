I've been a pretty serious mostly-hobby programmer since my family got
our first computer in 1993 (when I was 13). I've messed with tons of
different programming languages, from assembly languages to Haskell, as
well as writing my own toy languages.  I built my own GNU/Linux system
from source for a while.  I've tried a bunch of different game engines
and libraries (though mostly the more programmer-oriented ones, and I've
never gotten around to trying Unity).

Since 2007 I have been a full-time small farmer in Vienna, ME and do
programming and gamedev as a hobby.

I'm demonstrating [a bunch of games by family and
friends](./noreaster-2018.html) at the Nor'Easter 2018 expo in Bangor.
