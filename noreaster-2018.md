# Nor'Easter 2018 Games

I'm taking five games to demonstrate.  One that I wrote solo, two that
I collaborated on, and two by my brother Ross.

## Variations on Rockdodger

[Variations on Rockdodger](http://sametwice.com/vor) is a game that my
cousin Jason Woofenden and I reworked in 2004-2006. It's a fork of [an
earlier game](http://spacerocks.sourceforge.net/) by Paul Holt.

You simply dodge the rocks until you die. You have thrusters in the four
cardinal directions. The screen mostly scrolls freely to keep up with
your ship, though there is an invisible wall chasing you. Rocks bounce
off each other, and your thrusters push the rocks (though they're fairly
heavy).

Beginner challenge: you may only tap the keys (no holding). You may only
use the up/down keys (no left/right). Play on easy mode (press '1') and
try to make it to 45 seconds on a single life.


## Gunpods Vagabond

[Gunpods Vagabond](https://rossgrams.itch.io/gunpods-vagabond) was
written by Ross Grams in 2016 using the Godot engine.

A side-scrolling shoot-em-up. Fly a helicopter-like spaceship, using
your ship's dash attack and seven different weapons to blast through
waves of blocks, rocks, and 15 different enemy types. Deal with the
giant explosions of proximity mines, fend off swarms of tiny tracking
drones, dodge flights of fast-moving fighters, and try not to destroy
yourself or your friends with the grenade launcher.

Supports local co-op with up to three players.


## Asteroid Blaster

[Asteroid Blaster](https://rossgrams.itch.io/asteroidblaster) was
written by Ross Grams in 2017 using the Defold engine.

This was his exercise in taking a very simple game and making a complete
polished version to gain experience in end-to-end game development.

It has nice audio, jelly asteroids which subtly change shape, and two
enemy types. The lightweight bumbling blob enemies mostly putter around
minding their own business, and then occasionally run into you when
you?re not paying attention. Then there are the extremely dangerous
Hunters which chase you down and fire seeking missile blobs at you.

Your ammo slowly regenerates over time, or you get it back immediately
when you hit something, encouraging accuracy and penalizing misses.

Your bullets push the asteroids, so they can get going very fast if you
shoot them from behind. This adds another layer of tactics and makes the
blobs more dangerous, as they can move quite quickly when dodging
asteroids.


## Oxygen Trail

Oxygen Trail is an as-yet unreleased spare-time collaboration between
Philippe Patenaude, Michael Ackerson, and Joshua Grams. It has written
in the L?VE 2D engine starting in late October of 2017.

It's a lighthearted space adventure game loosely inspired by Oregon
Trail and [Seedship](http://philome.la/johnayliff/seedship/play). Manage
your food, water, air, and other resources as you traverse a hazardous
galaxy to bring your shipload of colonists to their new home.


## Yam of Endor

[Yam of Endor](https://joshgrams.itch.io/asctiiroid) is a game that I
started for the [2018 7-day Roguelike
Challenge](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2018), spending about 20
hours building the initial version, and a further 70 or so hours
polishing and tuning it. It's written in the L?VE 2D engine.

It's a turn-based roguelike space shooter where you explore five levels
of randomly generated caves to collect food, then return to the surface
to save your starving space colony.

This is an attempt to capture the feel of Asteroids games or cave flyers
but without the time pressure. So it still has that sense of momentum
and inevitability because it takes as long to stop as it did to get
going. And there?s still that tension between wanting to aim in this
direction to shoot the enemies but in that direction to slow down before
you crash into a wall. But you can stop at any point and take as long as
you like to think about what to do next.
